# Experiment 2: Blockchain-Based Crowdfunding (Kickstarter Alternative)

## Aim:
To create a decentralized crowdfunding platform where donors contribute funds only if the campaign goal is met.

## Algorithm:
A project owner starts a campaign with a funding goal and deadline.
### Step 1:
Deploy a smart contract where the project owner sets the funding goal and deadline.

### Step 2:
Define campaign details: project owner address, funding goal, deadline, total contributions, and contributors.

Contributors can send ETH to the campaign.
### Step 3:
Contributors send ETH to the campaign, and their contribution is recorded in the contract.

### Step 4:
The smart contract tracks the total ETH raised for the campaign.

If the goal is met before the deadline, funds are released to the project owner.
### Step 5:
After each contribution, check if the funding goal is met before the deadline.

### Step 6:
If the goal is met before the deadline, release funds to the project owner. If the goal isnâ€™t met before the deadline, allow contributors to withdraw their funds.

If the goal is not met, contributors can withdraw their funds.
### Step 7:
Contributors can withdraw their funds if the goal was not met.

### Step 8:
Once the deadline passes, the campaign ends, and either funds are released to the owner or refunded to contributors.
